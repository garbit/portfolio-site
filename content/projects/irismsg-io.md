[Iris](irismsg.io/), is a system that allows sending SMS text messages to a list of subscribers through SMS donors. People supporting your organisation, group or case can sign up to become 'donors' and donate a number of SMS messages for your cause, drawing upon their latent asset (remaining SMS messages from their call plan). Every time that you need to send a text to a list of subscribers (e.g. volunteers, staff, followers etc.) you share the cost of the text messages sent by routing the announcement through the distributed donor network and draw upon under-utilised assets. As a result, the communication of the organisation becomes more transparent and decentralised. Donors, through the Iris app, are able to see the content of the announcements sent, the subscription lists and sending and delivery reports.

IRISMsg was designed and developed by the research engineering team at Open Lab as part of our work with [Open Lab Athens](https://www.olathens.org) and solidarity groups in Greece.
