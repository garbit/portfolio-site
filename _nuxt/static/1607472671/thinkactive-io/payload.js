We deployed the system with a cohort of 30 school children, over a six-week period, in partnership with Newcastle United Foundationâ€™s health and nutrition programme (Match Fit). The system utilizes inexpensive activity trackers and pseudonymous avatars to promote reflection with personal data using an in-situ display within the classroom. Our design explores pseudonymity as an approach to managing privacy and personal data within a public setting. Within this research we explore the motivations, challenges, and opportunities for students, teachers, and third-party providers to engage in the collection and sharing of activity data with primary school children."}]},{type:a,value:c},{type:b,tag:"div",props:{className:["yt-container"]},children:[{type:a,value:"\n  "},{type:b,tag:"iframe",props:{src:"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.youtube.com\u002Fembed\u002FWgoeZkUkd_o",allow:"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture",allowFullScreen:true,frameBorder:"0",className:["video"]},children:[]},{type:a,value:c}]}]},dir:"\u002Fprojects",path:"\u002Fprojects\u002Fthinkactive-io",extension:".md",slug:"thinkactive-io",createdAt:d,updatedAt:d}}],fetch:[],mutations:void 0}}("text","element","\n","2020-12-09T00:10:15.851Z")));
